#Homework 1
 
During this homework we will be creating a multi-threaded file download, which will be the basis for the next homeworks and final project.
 
Our homeworks will be built around analyzing the "Hanraqve 2016" registry data published by the Police of RA.
The files are available [here](http://www.police.am/Hanraqve/ "here") **(Please notice the use of capital "H" in the link provided.)**
 
You must write a downloader which will download all the Microsoft Excel files located in the sub-folders of the "Hanraqve".
All the files must be placed in a single local directory of your computer.
 
The file downloader must provide the following functionality:
+ The file download must be done in a manner that will use all the resources of the system in a most optimal fashion.
+ Think of a smart way for discovering the number of files in the sun directories.
+ Provide GUI interface (WinForms or WPF) with a progress bar that illustrates the progress of the overall download.
+ Provide a cancelation option for overall downlaod operation.
 
Bonus points:
+ Provide cancelation for a single directory.
+ Implement good exception handling.
+ Implement I/O operation in a async fashion.
